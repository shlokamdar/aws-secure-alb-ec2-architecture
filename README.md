# aws-secure-alb-ec2-architecture
Designed and deployed a secure, production-style AWS web architecture using private EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer with HTTPS enabled via ACM and DNS routing through Route 53.  The architecture follows AWS best practices for networking, security, and high availability using isolated subnets, NAT Gateway, and a Bastion Host.
